# Simple_Investing
Application that computes financial ratios to evaluate public companies.
The goal of the app is to create a portfolio of companies that the user is interested in, and compute the financial ratios that most analysts use to assess whether a company is potentially undervalued. 
To add a company to the portfolio, the user will have to insert data, such as revenue, net income, free cashflow, etc.  
The user also has the option of getting the same information by entering the ticker symbol of the company. The application is connected to Yahoo finance Api, which allows the user to retrieve the pertinent information.
The purpose of this last feature is to give a faster option to users who do not want to spend time reading a company's annual reports in order to get the information needed.
